Feature: Test Run Property Bag
    AS A PROGRAMMER WHO DILIGENTLY DEBUGS THEIR CODE
    I WANT TO KNOW WHETHER THE TEST RUN PROPERTY BAG STORES AND RETURNS PROPERTIES CORRECTLY


    Scenario:   [01/02] Read Property From Configuration
        When    I READ THE "Favourite Colour" PROPERTY
        Then    THE "Favourite Colour" PROPERTY SHOULD BE "black"

    Scenario:   [02/02] Property Store To And Retrieve From Test Run Context
        When    I STORE THE "Favourite Movie" PROPERTY WITH THE VALUE "Fight Club"
        Then    THE "Favourite Movie" PROPERTY SHOULD BE "Fight Club"
