Feature: Random Assertions
    AS A PROGRAMMER WHO DILIGENTLY DEBUGS THEIR CODE
    I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT FROM RANDOM SEQUENCES OF EVENTS


    Scenario:   [01/01] Random Assertions
        When    I SET A RANDOM STATUS FOR STEP #1
        When    I SET A RANDOM STATUS FOR STEP #2
        When    I SET A RANDOM STATUS FOR STEP #3
        When    I SET A RANDOM STATUS FOR STEP #4
